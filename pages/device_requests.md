_Komodo OS, please support my new device!_

It's up to you.

Sorry to let you down, but Komodo OS device support has nothing to do with the number of device requests received. The folks who maintain devices for Komodo OS choose devices that interest them. Remember, these are regular people enjoying a hobby. Komodo OS is not a corporation with employees.

If you know someone who has knowledge in building ROMs, you can send [this url]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/adding-device/) to that person.
